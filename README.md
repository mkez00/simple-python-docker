# simple-python-docker
Ridiculously simple script running in docker.  Not really a good use for anything.  Script simply outputs 4 randomly generated GUIDs

# Docker Build
Run: `docker build -t mkez00/simple-python-docker .` from project root (-t option allows you to name the repository)

# Docker Hub Push
Run: `docker push mkez00/simple-python-docker`
